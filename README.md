# DataVault - Protecting Your Data on the Blockchain

DataVault is a decentralized application (Dapp) that allows users to store their passwords and files securely and privately on the blockchain. It uses encryption to protect user data and stores the encrypted information on the blockchain, ensuring that only the user with the private key can access it.
