# DataVault - Protecting Your Data on the Blockchain

DataVault is a decentralized application (Dapp) that allows users to store their passwords and files securely and privately on the blockchain. It uses encryption to protect user data and stores the encrypted information on the blockchain, ensuring that only the user with the private key can access it.

## Inspiration
The rise of data breaches and hacks has made data security a top priority for individuals and businesses. We were inspired to create a solution that could offer a secure and decentralized way to store sensitive data, such as passwords and files.

## What it does
DataVault is a decentralized application (Dapp) that allows users to store their passwords and files securely and privately on the blockchain. It uses encryption to protect user data and stores the encrypted information on the blockchain, ensuring that only the user with the private key can access it.

## How we built it
We built DataVault using a variety of technologies. We used Solidity, a programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, to create the smart contract that handles the encryption and storage of user data. We used Reactjs for the frontend, which allows users to easily interact with the Dapp through a web browser. We used Nodejs + Express js for the backend, which handles the business logic and communicates with the smart contract via Etherjs, a library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. We also used Hardhat for smart contract testing and deployment, which helped us ensure that the smart contract is functioning as intended and deploy it to the blockchain.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was optimizing the storage and retrieval of data on the blockchain. We had to find a way to balance security and efficiency while keeping the costs low. We also had to ensure that the data should be secure.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're especially proud of the advanced file encryption feature we added, which enhances the security of the Dapp. We're proud to have developed a solution that offers a secure and decentralized way to store sensitive data. We're also proud of the user interface we developed, which we believe makes it easy for users to manage their data. We're also proud of the testing and deployment process we developed using Hardhat, which helped us ensure that the smart contract is functioning as intended.

## What we learned
Through the development of DataVault, we learned a lot about blockchain, IPFS technologies, Shardeum and Spheron and their potential for secure and decentralized storage solutions. Also learned ways to encrypt files

## What's next for DataVault
In the future, we plan to add more features to DataVault, such as the ability to share encrypted files securely with others. We can also create a browser extension that can automatically fill passwords in other websites. We also plan to optimize the performance of the Dapp and make it even more user-friendly.
